# 👩🏻‍💻 Contributing to Concurrent Tasks

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

-   Reporting a bug
-   Discussing the current state of the code
-   Submitting a fix
-   Proposing new features
-   Becoming a maintainer

## 🙋🏻‍ We develop with Github

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## 👷🏻‍ All code changes happen through pull requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

-   Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
-   If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
-   If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
-   Ensure the test suite passes.
-   Make sure your code lints.
-   Issue that pull request!

## 👀 Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/samrith-s/concurrent-tasks/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/samrith-s/concurrent-tasks/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

## ✍🏼 Issue creation

We have templates setup for all kinds of issues. If your issue does not fall under any of the templates, you can create an issue from scratch. Do try to include as much info and explanation as possible as it will help us a lot in understanding and resolving it.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

-   A quick summary and/or background
-   Steps to reproduce
    -   Be specific!
    -   Give sample code if you can.
-   What you expected would happen
-   What actually happens
-   Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People _love_ thorough bug reports. We're not even kidding.

## 🤓 Feature requests

We absolutely welcome whatever feature requests, ideas you guys might have. Please create a [Feature Request](https://github.com/samrith-s/concurrent-tasks/issues/new?template=feature_request.md) and we will collaborate with you on it. We love it when people create PRs for new features. Please feel free to do the same!

Before requesting for a feature, though, please go through our [Roadmap](https://github.com/samrith-s/concurrent-tasks#roadmap) and see if it's already in the pipeline or something we do not intend to do.

## 🧐 Use a consistent coding style

Our linters will majorly take care of everything. All you need to remember is to write "attractive" code.
